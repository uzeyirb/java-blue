# Week 9 Team Exercise: Web page design challenge

## Context

In a few weeks you will be tasked with designing the look of your final capstone project with a team of your fellow classmates. To prepare you for this experience, today you will participate in a design challenge for the most professional and attractive site. 
We have provided a skeleton html with some content and few images. Feel free to use them or do something different. 

## Requirements

* Use semantic HTML as much as possible (we will look at your code)
* Apply an effect to hyperlinks when the mouse is over it
* Design considerations for phone, tablet and desktop

## Notes and tips

* The mobile breakpoint can be 800px since a separate tablet layout isn't required.
* It might be helpful to use Grid or Flexbox to align elements within sections.
