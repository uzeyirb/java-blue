    A constructor is a special method that runs every time a new object is instantiated.
    It allows for the object to be initialized with a starting state.
    The name must exactly match the Class name
    It has no return type
    Can have arguments that set the value of member variables, like a Setter.
    Can be Overridden to provide multiple ways to instantiate the object
    If no constructor is present, then Java provides a default constructor, which has no arguments.
    if any constructor is present then the default constructor is not provided,
    and if a no-argument overload of the constructor is needed, then it must be explicitly created.
    Important: Constructor can call any private method but it should never call public method for 2
    reasons: 1. Security and public method we can change from outside of the class
    2. it is possible that the way java works when it is built it take all private methods and it is
    possible when it will call public method and it will not be there and the build will crash
    We can have multiple constructor overloads with different sets of arguments
    If there is a constructor Overload then the no-argument constructor must be explicitly included
    if we want the class to be able to instantiated without passing arguments
    for example: Bus bus = new Bus();

    A derived property is a getter that, instead of returning a member variable,

     A function or method, is like a mathematical function (e.g. f(n) = n^2 ).
     Methods can have multiple parameters but can only return one value (for now).
     Public methods define object behaviors.
     Public and Private Methods help by
     making the code base manageable with smaller chunks
     reducing code into small units of work, making debugging simpler
     and introducing reuse.
     Overloaded methods are methods with the same name and return type,
     and a different set of parameters.  Java uses the correct overload based on the
     parameters sent to it.  In the code below we will overload it to make more functional

    /*Rules of Abstract Method
    1. Abstract methods donâ€™t have body, they just have method signature
    as shown below.
    2. If a class has an abstract method it should be declared abstract,
    the vice versa is not true, which means an abstract class
    does not need to have an abstract method compulsory.
    3. If a regular class extends an abstract class,
    then the class must have to implement all the abstract methods
    of abstract parent class or it has to be declared abstract as well.
